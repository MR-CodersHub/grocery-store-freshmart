      content: `<p>Understanding seasonality is the key to getting the freshest, most flavorful produce at the best prices. When fruits and vegetables are in season, they're harvested at peak ripeness, which means better taste and more nutrients.</p>
      <h2>Spring (March – May)</h2>
      <p>Spring brings tender greens, asparagus, peas, strawberries, and artichokes. This is the time to enjoy light, fresh salads and the first berries of the year.</p>
      <h2>Summer (June – August)</h2>
      <p>Summer is peak season for tomatoes, corn, peaches, watermelon, zucchini, and berries. The warm weather means an abundance of colorful, juicy produce perfect for grilling and fresh eating.</p>
      <h2>Fall (September – November)</h2>
      <p>Autumn harvest includes apples, pears, squash, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and cranberries. These heartier ingredients are perfect for roasting and comfort dishes.</p>
      <h2>Winter (December – February)</h2>
      <p>Winter produce features citrus fruits, root vegetables, cabbage, and kale. Citrus is at its absolute peak, with blood oranges, grapefruits, and mandarins offering bright flavors in the cold months.</p>
      <h2>Shop Seasonal with FreshMart</h2>
      <p>At FreshMart, we source directly from local farms so you always get what's freshest. Our seasonal highlights rotate weekly — check our app for this week's picks!</p>`

      content: `<p>The organic food movement has grown significantly over the past decade, and for good reason. Here's why choosing organic makes a difference for your health and the environment.</p>
      <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
      <p>Organic foods are grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Studies show they can have higher levels of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. By choosing organic, you reduce your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals.</p>
      <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
      <p>Organic farming practices support soil health, biodiversity, and water quality. No synthetic chemicals means less pollution in our waterways and healthier ecosystems.</p>
      <h2>Taste Difference</h2>
      <p>Many people report that organic produce simply tastes better. Without artificial growth accelerators, fruits and vegetables grow at their natural pace, developing fuller, more complex flavors.</p>
      <h2>Supporting Local Farms</h2>
      <p>When you buy organic from FreshMart, you're supporting local farmers who are committed to sustainable practices. Our network includes over 80 certified organic farms within 100 miles.</p>`

      content: `<p>Meal prepping is one of the best strategies for eating healthy on a busy schedule. With just 2-3 hours on Sunday, you can prepare all your meals for the week.</p>
      <h2>Step 1: Plan Your Meals</h2>
      <p>Choose 3-4 recipes that use overlapping ingredients to minimize waste. A good rule: one grain, one protein, two vegetables per meal.</p>
      <h2>Step 2: Shop Smart</h2>
      <p>Order everything from FreshMart in one go. Our bulk discounts make meal prep even more affordable.</p>
      <h2>Step 3: Batch Cook</h2>
      <p>Cook grains first (rice, quinoa), then proteins (chicken, tofu, beans), then roast vegetables. This sequence keeps your kitchen efficient.</p>
      <h2>Step 4: Store Properly</h2>
      <p>Use glass containers for better freshness. Most prepped meals last 4-5 days in the fridge. Freeze anything you won't eat by Thursday.</p>`

      <h2>Reduce Food Waste</h2>
      <p>Plan meals, buy only what you need, and use our portion guides to avoid over-purchasing. Our meal kits are pre-portioned to eliminate waste entirely.</p>
      <h2>Sustainable Packaging</h2>
      <p>FreshMart uses 100% recyclable and compostable packaging. We've eliminated single-use plastics from our supply chain entirely.</p>
